## Quickstart

First, check you have the [govuk-guix][govuk-guix] repository on
your machine. If you do not, clone it using Git.

In the `bin` directory of the `govuk-guix` repository, there is a
`govuk-data` script that can be used to download and use data related
to GOV.UK services.

To check what data is available, run `govuk-data list`.

To load the latest available data for a specific service (e.g. the
publishing-api), run the following command `govuk-data load
publishing-api`.

If the service has multiple databases, then use the `--database`
option to specifiy which you wish to load (this option can be
speficied multiple times).

Older dumps can be restored (if available) by using the `--after` or
`--before` options, which will select the first dataset either before
or after the specified date.

### Listing

The `list` command also supports the `--database`, `--before` and
`--after` options.

(TODO: Possibly use the rec format?)

## Implementation

### Data sources

A data source can be queried as to what data it has available. Each
returned item must have:

 - date
   - This should approxomate to when the data was extracted.
 - database (e.g. PostgreSQL, MySQL, ...)
   - The database the data was extracted from.
 - services (e.g. publishing-api-service-type)
   - The services that can use this data.

#### GOV.UK development repository data source

This data source is designed to be used with the private GOV.UK
development repository. It contains scripts to download data from the
GOV.UK integration environment. After these scripts are run, the
downloaded files are stored in the `replication/backups` directory.

These files, specifically only the downloaded archives, not any of the
extracted files can be used by the local data source.
